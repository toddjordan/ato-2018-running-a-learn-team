* So What's a Learn Team?

** Ember Learn Mission Statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The mission of the Ember Learning Team is to empower
Ember users to learn, build and teach. \\
\\
The team is responsible for keeping the guides and API documentation updated,
and managing initiatives that support learning Ember.

#+END_QUOTE

** Not Just a Docs Team
From the initial Ember Learn Team Charter: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Documentation is just one part of how new users learn to use Ember. People start learning the second they land on the website homepage, or when they see a presentation at their local user group.
#+END_QUOTE

** Holistic Learning

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...We want to make holistic learning a central part of Ember... this means thinking about how members of the community interact, how they get help, and how we introduce them to new features...

** A Learn Team Evolves

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Core team worked great, but team members tended to be focused on new features and development on the core library.
One of the core members put a ton of work into documentation.  
As the project grew and as more emphasis was put on documentation, a more formal group was needed.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
So in 2016 we announced "sub teams", additional "official teams" to be responsible for development of core parts of ember
outside is main architecture.
- CLI 
- Data
- Learn 

See https://emberjs.com/blog/2016/05/19/introducing-subteams.html

"While the Ember CLI and Ember Data subteams should be self-explanatory, this one is the newest and may require some explanation.
We intentionally did not call this subteam Documentation, because documentation is just one part of how new users learn to use Ember. People start learning the second they land on the website homepage, or when they see a presentation at their local user group.
We want to make holistic learning a central part of Ember. In addition to good guides and API documentation, this means thinking about how members of the community interact, how they get help, and how we introduce them to new features added via the RFC process.
The Learning Subteam is responsible for the website, the guides, the API docs and making sure the Core Team is aware of common pitfalls people hit, like confusing error messages or APIs. We will take this information and feed it back into the framework itself.
The best documentation is the documentation you never have to write. By reducing complexity, making errors clearer, and smoothing the learning curve, we can help Ember reach an entirely new audience."

* Why A Learning Team?

** The learning experience can make or break a technology

*** Much of the tech OSS Culture is "What's hot right now"

#+REVEAL_HTML:<image src="images/so-hot.gif" style="height:400px;border-width:0;box-shadow:unset;">

*** There are many "X vs Y vs Z!" posts
#+REVEAL_HTML:<image src="images/vs.gif" style="height:400px;border-width:0;box-shadow:unset;">
#+BEGIN_NOTES
  - These takes typically rely solely on initial experiences, rarely get into issues when building an full stack production app.
  - Having a great first experience is big
